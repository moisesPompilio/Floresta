floresta_cli_getdeploymentinfo.py

Functional test for `getdeploymentinfo`. Mines blocks via utreexod, then
compares florestad's response against bitcoind's for each buried deployment.

Floresta currently emits only buried deployments (bip34, bip66, bip65, csv,
segwit). Bitcoin Core also emits BIP9 deployments (taproot, testdummy) which
require the versionbits state machine; those keys are present in bitcoind's
response but skipped on the floresta side.
